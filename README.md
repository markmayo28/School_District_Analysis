# City School Analysis

## Project Overview

The city school district initially asked us to review standardized test scores across the city schools to look for trends in test results based on several factors:

1. How does school size effect test scores.
2. How does the school budgets effect test scores
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate4 received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources

- Data Source: election_results.csv (provided by the Colorado Board of Elections)
- Software: Python 3.9.4, Visual Studio Code 1.55.2

## Summary

The analysis of the election show that: 

- There were 369,711 votes cast in the election

- The candidates were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham
  - Diana DeGette
  - Raymon Anthony Doane

- The results by candidate were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham received 85,312 votes, which was 23% of the total votes cast.
  - Diana DeGette received 272,892 votes, which was 73.8% of the total votes cast.
  - Raymon Anthony Doane received 11,606 votes, which was 3.1% of the total votes cast.

- The winner of the election was Diana DeGette, who received 272,892 votes, which was 73.8% of the total votes cast.

## Additional Anaysis

Colorado Board of Elections asked us to further analyze the election data to determine:

1. The voter turnout for each county
2. The percentage of votes from each county and of the total count.
3. The county with the highest turnout.

## Summary of Results

The analysis of the county data shows that:

- There were three counties included in the election results:
  - Jefferson
  - Denver
  - Arapahoe

- The results by county were:
  - Jefferson county with 38,855 voters which was 10.5% of the overall turnout.
  - Denver county with 306,055 voters which was 82.8% of the overall turnout.
  - Arapahoe county with 24,801 voters which was 6.7% of the overall turnout.

- Denver county had far and away the highest voter turnout with over four times the number of voters than the other two counties combined.

## Audit Summary

The programming script used in this analysis is very versatile and can be adjusted to meet future vote counting needs. The programming script can easily be modified to match with a larger number of counties to include a statewide election. Along the same lines it can also be changed to recognize different candidates and a larger candidate pool. This script will also prove useful to compare election turnout and results across multiple election years. We hope you will find this information meets your needs and will think of us for future projects.
